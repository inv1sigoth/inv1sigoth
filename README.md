<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lucy</h1>
<h3 align="center">You've probably heard my name!</h3>

I'm a variety developer that dabbles in multiple fields such as web, desktop (Windows), Discord, front, and back end development. Not that I'm good at a couple of those, mind you, but I try. My main fields are Discord, back end, and Windows desktop apps. I normally use TypeScript for the first two and C# for the last one, however I'm experimenting with other languages too.
